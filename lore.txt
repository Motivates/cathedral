**INTRODUCING THE CATHEDRAL & THE KNIGHT:**



The Cathedral was a massive edifice located at the brink of the known world. It was understood to be a place of malevolence and peril, where beings beyond comprehension prowled and shadows concealed unspeakable horrors.



Its atmosphere was peculiar and discomforting, a pulsing energy that fluctuated with the movements of the air and sky. At times, the atmosphere was tranquil and serene, but at others, it was gloomy and menacing.



Individuals who neared The Cathedral often felt a sense of unease, as if they were being monitored by unseen forces. They whispered of eerie sounds that reverberated within its walls, of whispers carried by the breeze, and of an aura that defied explanation.



Despite its reputation as a place of terror, some were still entranced by The Cathedral's mysteries and aura. But they soon realized that The Cathedral was not to be trifled with, and those who ventured inside never returned.

The myths about The Cathedral only grew stronger over time, and its attraction only heightened. Yet, those who believed they knew the truth, understood that The Cathedral was a place of danger, where only the brave and the foolish dared to enter.



Upon this forsaken land said to be shrouded with darkness, there existed a mysterious guardian known only as "Knight the Noble". His reputation for secrecy preceded him, and few knew of his true nature. He roamed the lands, searching for something that would quell the emptiness within him.



Venturing the gloomy atmosphere, he discovered The Cathedral. He noted the rumors of how it was a place of evil, filled with monstrous creatures that no one dared to approach. But the Knight was drawn to the strange aura that surrounded it, and he wandered inside.



What he found within the cathedral was not what he expected. The creatures were not aggressive, but instead, they respected the Knight's presence for his audacious entry and allowed him to reign over The Cathedral. He was given a glimpse into their strange world, filled with magic and ancient secrets.



Knight the Noble was intrigued, and he decided to stay in The Cathedral, becoming its ruler and protector. He learned to understand the creatures, and they soon became fond of the guardian. The Knight showed them the hidden power behind this kingdom he now reigned over, and the monsters and creatures within swore to protect The Cathedral against all who threatened it.



New legends of Knight the Noble and "The Cathedral" spread throughout the land. People whispered of the mysterious noble who ruled over a world of monsters, and of the strange aura that surrounded the cathedral. No one may dare to approach it, but many wondered what secrets lay within its walls.



=============================



**INTRODUCING THE SERAPHIM:**



Knight the Noble was on a quest to explore the many secrets within the walls that remained mystery to outsiders. He roamed the halls, learning of the creatures that lived within and growing The Cathedral with nothing but the most powerful beings. But one day, the Knight grew back to his void, as if something was still missing from his life. The purpose behind it all.



That was until he met a fierce, yet stunning seraphim named "Daunting,” who was fabled to be the owner of the sky. Tales from ancient described her as the embodiment of naturalistic force, with the ability to control the winds and the clouds. But despite her strength, she was plagued by a sense of restlessness.



The Knight saw something in Daunting that he recognized in himself and he took it upon himself to show her what it truly meant to embrace her powers. He took her on a journey through The Cathedral, revealing its secrets and the wisdom of the creatures who lived there.



Daunting was amazed by what she saw, and she realized that her powers were not just for destruction, but also for protection. She was the chosen one to rule the sky, and her duty was to maintain balance between the Cathedral and the lands beyond its walls.



As they continued their journey, they grew closer to each other. The Knight was the only one who could keep the seraphim serene, and she was the only one who could bring a smile to his face.

**INTRODUCING THE MAD DOG:**



Years would pass since Knight the Noble and Daunting became the most respected beings within the Cathedral, with the seraphim still conquering the skies and the Knight still reigning over his rightful palace. The world was still far from peace, and yet the creatures of the Cathedral lived in harmony. But Knight the Noble knew that peace within its walls would not be permanent, and he had to always be prepared for any eventuality.



One day, the Knight decided that he needed a trustworthy, yet unpredictable assassin to keep watch over the most unknown parts of the Cathedral. He discussed his concerns with Daunting, who knew just the person for the job.

She introduced the Knight to a man nicknamed the "Mad Dog,” later revealing his name to be Majima. Majima was a man who lived on the edge, known for his unrivaled combat skills and his unpredictable nature. He was feared by many, but Daunting had faith in him.



The Knight was hesitant at first, but after seeing Majima in action, he was convinced that he was the perfect candidate for the job. Majima was recruited as the assassin that Knight was looking for, and he took on the task with enthusiasm.



Majima was tasked with exploring the most unknown parts of the Cathedral, and reporting back to the Knight with any threats or danger that he encountered. He was the eyes and ears of the Knight, and his skills were put to the test.



Majima's unpredictable nature made him an unpredictable weapon, and his enemies never knew what hit them. The creatures of the Cathedral soon learned to respect him, and he became a legend in his own right.

 INTRODUCING AXSEL, THE EMPTY: 



Deep in the heart of the kingdoms, amidst rolling hills and the dense forests, more and more whispers became prevalent... they soon shrouded the land. Whispers of a place of great sanctity - The Cathedral. The magnificent structure said to be more than just a named institution; a haven for those seeking refuge and a beacon of hope in a world shrouded in darkness. Word spread far and wide, and it was to this remarkable structure that Axsel, the Empty, was drawn. 



Axsel had long been wandering the land, searching for something he could not name. He was a mysterious figure, draped in a dark, yet determined medieval attire, and his very presence evoked a sense of unease in those around him. The people whispered rumors of his villainous nature, and yet there was an inexplicable allure about him that drew others in.



It was no sheer chance that Axsel would one day gaze upon the Cathedral. The word that had spread across the land stating Knight the Noble, a figure shrouded in equal parts mystery and heroism, had taken refuge and leadership there. And it was the promise of this connection to Knight that drew Axsel to the Cathedral's gates.



Upon entering the sanctuary, Axsel's presence was immediately felt by all who encountered him. His aura seemed to suffocate the very air around him, as if the mana contained within his empty soul was immense. But how could such an empty essence contain such inexplicable power? The truth is, it seemed that nobody knew.



Those who dared to look into his eyes saw only emptiness staring back at them. And yet, there was a sense of familiarity between Axsel and the Cathedral's inhabitants, as if he was somehow connected to them.



It was soon revealed that Axsel was, in fact, related to Knight the Noble, although the nature of their connection remained shrouded in mystery. What was clear, however, was the fact that Axsel was a man consumed by emptiness. His love for nothingness had led him down a path of discord, and he reveled in the chaos that surrounded him.



Despite his villainous nature, Axsel quickly became a key ally to the Cathedral and all its inhabitants. While his presence continued to unsettle many, there was a deep respect for Axsel among those who knew him well.



For even though Axsel was empty on the inside, he possessed a fierce loyalty and unwavering commitment to the Cathedral's cause. And it was this dedication that endeared him to the Cathedral's inhabitants, who saw in him a kindred spirit - one who had also been drawn to the sanctuary by a sense of longing and a desire to belong.



As for Axsel himself, he remained an enigma, his true nature and motivations known only to him. But one thing was certain - as long as the Cathedral stood, Axsel would remain by its side, a silent guardian consumed by the emptiness within, yet fiercely devoted to the cause he had come to call his own.
